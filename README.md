# Phone-localization

My task is to implement a prototype of a visual object detection system.  Model has been designed to find a location of a phone dropped on the floor from a single RGB camera image. The customer has only one type of phone he is interested in detecting. 
Accuracy of model observed is 70% of test image split(90 :10)
